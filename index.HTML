  <h2>WEB</h2>
  <p>The World Wide Web, also known as the WWW and the Web, is an information space
  where documents and other web resources are identified by Uniform Resource
  Locators (URLs), interlinked by hypertext links, and accessible via the Internet.
  English scientist Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web in 1989.
  He wrote the first web browser in 1990 while employed at CERN near Geneva,
  Switzerland.The browser was released outside CERN in 1991, first to other research
  institutions starting in January 1991 and to the general public on the Internet
  in August 1991.</p><p>The World Wide Web has been central to the development of the
  Information Age and is the primary tool billions of people use to interact on
  the Internet.Web pages are primarily text documents formatted and annotated
  with Hypertext Markup Language (HTML).In addition to formatted text, web pages
  may contain images, video, audio, and software components that are rendered in
  the user's web browser as coherent pages of multimedia content.</p>
